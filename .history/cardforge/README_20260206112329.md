# Card Battle Card Maker

**Card Battle Card Maker** is a powerful, Windows-first desktop application designed for creating, balancing, and exporting assets for trading card games (TCG) and tabletop RPGs. Whether you are prototyping a new game or managing a massive database of items, this tool streamlines the pipeline from concept to game-ready assets.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This tool combines a visual blueprint editor with data-driven batch processing. It allows designers to generate card concepts using AI, balance stats programmatically, and export everything directly into game-ready formats (JSON/ZIP).

## ✨ Key Features

- **🤖 AI-Powered Generation**: Instantly generate card concepts, stats (HP, Attack), lore descriptions, and image prompts based on a theme using **Google Gemini AI** (`gemini-1.5-flash`).
- **📊 Bulk Data Management**: Import and manage card data via **CSV** or **Excel (.xlsx)** files.
- **⚖️ Auto-Balancing**: Includes advanced algorithms to calculate balanced stats based on rarity (Common to Legendary), cost, and abilities.
- **🎨 Visual Editor**: A professional canvas editor (powered by Konva) with snapping, layers, and multi-selection for designing card layouts.
- **📦 Game-Ready Export**: Batch export cards as images or generate a comprehensive `cards.json` with a ZIP of assets for direct integration into game engines.
- **⚔️ Deck Simulator**: Built-in simulation tools to test win rates and balance between generated decks.
- **🌍 Localization**: Full support for English and Arabic (RTL), including localized template rendering.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project leverages a modern web-based stack wrapped in Electron for desktop capabilities:

- **Core**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Desktop Shell**: Electron
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI SDK (Gemini)
- **Graphics & Canvas**: Konva
- **State Management**: Zustand

## Architecture Decisions

- **Electron + Vite + React** for fast iteration and a native Windows-first desktop shell.
- **Konva** for a performant canvas editor with transforms and export.
- **Zustand** for light state management.
- **PapaParse** for CSV ingestion.

## Core Concepts

- **Project**: A single `.cardsmith.json` file containing sets, blueprints, items, data tables, and assets.
- **Set**: A collection such as "Base Deck" or "Tokens".
- **Blueprint**: A template describing layout + layers + bindings.
- **Item**: An instance generated from a blueprint + row of data.

## Phase 1 - Editor UX (Implemented)

New features:
- Multi-selection with Shift+Click and marquee drag selection.
- Snap system with grid + smart guides (canvas center and element edges/centers).
- Optional grid visibility toggle.
- Pro-grade layers panel with drag-and-drop reorder, visibility, lock, and rename.
- Properties panel supports multi-selection with mixed state indicators.
- Resize elements via canvas handles (Konva Transformer), with image lock-ratio toggle.
- Image fit modes for image layers: contain / cover / fill.

Shortcuts:
- `Ctrl+S` save
- `Ctrl+Z` undo
- `Ctrl+Y` redo
- `Ctrl+D` duplicate
- `Arrow keys` nudge by 1px
- `Shift+Arrow` nudge by 10px
- `Space+drag` pan
- `Ctrl+wheel` zoom

Known limitations:
- Multi-selection transforms are disabled (move/nudge only).
- Snapping uses axis-aligned bounds (rotated elements snap by bounds).

Next steps:
- Phase 2 export pipeline (batch/export settings + PDF sheet export).

## Phase 2 - Data + Export (Implemented)

New features:
- CSV/JSON import with dot-path keys (e.g., `stats.attack`) normalized into nested data.
- Excel (.xlsx) import using the first worksheet.
- Binding mapper for text/image elements via `bindingKey`.
- Batch export pipeline with progress UI and cancel.
- Windows-safe filename templating with `{{name}}_{{id}}` and quantity suffixes.

Known limitations:
- Export is PNG-only (PDF/SVG are still roadmap items).

Next steps:
- PDF sheet export (imposition) and SVG export.

## Phase 3 - Template Library + Assets (Implemented)

New features:
- Template Gallery with search, categories, thumbnails, and “Create Project”.
- Asset pipeline under `apps/renderer/public/assets/...` for template imagery.
- Assets screen to import project images and drag them onto the canvas.

Known limitations:
- Built-in template set is minimal (expandable).

Next steps:
- Add more curated templates and thumbnails.

## Phase 5 - Localization (Implemented)

New features:
- Full i18n (English + Arabic) with runtime language toggle.
- RTL layout switching and Arabic-friendly font stack.
- Localized template names and descriptions.

Known limitations:
- Arabic copy will be refined during UX review.

Next steps:
- Expand localized sample data and help content.

## Template JSON Schema (Brief)

Each template is a JSON file in `/templates`:

```json
{
  "id": "fantasy-basic",
  "name": "Fantasy Basic",
  "category": "Fantasy",
  "size": { "w": 750, "h": 1050 },
  "background": "#0f1c33",
  "elements": [
    {
      "id": "title",
      "type": "text",
      "name": "Title",
      "x": 90, "y": 40, "w": 570, "h": 60,
      "rotation": 0, "visible": true, "zIndex": 1,
      "text": "{{name}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each element supports:
- `id, type, name, x, y, w, h, rotation, visible, zIndex`
- Style props per type (text, shape, image, icon)
- `bindingKey` to bind data directly

## Data Bindings

Text supports placeholders:
- `{{name}}`
- `{{stats.attack}}`

Image elements can bind to a field via `bindingKey`:
- `bindingKey: "art"` (expects a data URL or local file path)

Excel import:
- The first worksheet is used.
- Column headers become data keys (dot-paths supported).

Example Excel columns:

| name | stats.attack | art | quantity | set |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Knight | 4 | knight.png | 2 | Base Deck |

Image binding:
- Choose the image column and an images folder in **Data → Image Binding**.
- If a cell contains an absolute path or `file://`, it is used directly.
- Otherwise, the value is resolved inside the selected folder (extensions tried: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`).
- Missing images fall back to a configurable placeholder and are reported after export.
- Optional “Copy images into project assets” stores files under `assets/images/` for portability.

Assets:
- Use `/assets/...` URLs (from `apps/renderer/public/assets`) inside templates or data.
- Imported project images are stored under `<projectRoot>/assets/images/` and referenced as `assets/images/<file>`.
- Drag assets from the **Assets** screen onto the canvas to create image elements.

Set assignment:
- Add a `set` column in your CSV/JSON matching a Set name (defaults to the first Set if missing).

## Batch Export Workflow

1. Import CSV/JSON in **Data**.
2. Map columns to bindings.
3. Set `quantity` per row (optional).
4. Go to **Export**, choose output folder.
5. Export batch PNGs.

Filenames are generated from templates such as `{{name}}_{{id}}` and sanitized to be Windows-safe. When `quantity` is greater than 1, copies are exported with `_1.._N` suffixes.

Progress and cancel controls are available during batch export.

## Security Model (Electron)

- `contextIsolation: true`
- `nodeIntegration: false`
- `sandbox: true`
- Minimal preload API (`open/save/read/write/selectFolder/openImageFiles/copyFile`)

## Troubleshooting

- **Windows path issues**: Use local file paths or `file://` URLs for bound images.
- **Export permissions**: Ensure the destination folder is writable.
- **Packaging**: Run `npm run dist` from the repo root.
- **Missing modules**: Run the per-package installs above if `npm run dev` cannot find Electron or Vite dependencies.

## Roadmap

- PDF sheet export (imposition) and SVG export
- Icon library + asset manager
- Blueprint rules (auto-fit, overflow, text shrink)
- Plugin system for custom exporters and renderers
- Cloud sync for templates and data
